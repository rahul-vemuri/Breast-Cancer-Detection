# Breast-Cancer-Detection
- The primary objective of this project is to apply unsupervised clustering techniques to the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset to identify natural groupings of malignant (‘M’) and benign (‘B’) tumors without using labeled data during training.  
- Using algorithms such as K-Means, Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), and Agglomerative Clustering, the study aims to separate the two diagnostic classes effectively.
- This analysis benefits healthcare stakeholders by providing an automated, data-driven approach to tumor classification, potentially aiding early diagnosis and treatment planning.
- By evaluating clustering performance against true labels, the study demonstrates the viability of unsupervised methods in medical diagnostics, offering cost-effective insights for clinicians and researchers.
